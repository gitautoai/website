1. **Speed Insights**: Automatically analyzes website performance and suggests improvements. Access this via the Vercel dashboard under the "Integrations" section.

2. **Web Analytics**: Tracks visits, bounce rates, and other key metrics to provide insights into user behavior. Also found in the "Integrations" section of the Vercel dashboard.

### Configuration and Testing

After installation, both tools should be configured according to the project's needs. Performance goals for Speed Insights and specific event tracking for Web Analytics should be set up.

Ensure to test the integration by visiting the site and checking if the data is correctly recorded in the Vercel dashboard.
