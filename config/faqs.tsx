    question: `If I install GitAuto in my company's repository, will our entire code base be sent to OpenAI?`,
    answer: `No, simply installing it will not send anything. When you assign an issue to GitAuto on GitHub, the file tree structure of the repository is sent, and only the necessary files are referenced as needed based on the issue's content.`,
  },
  {
    category: "data",
    question: `Do issues or code sent to OpenAI from our company's repository remain on OpenAI's servers?`,
    answer: `No, they do not. We have a Business Associate Agreement with OpenAI, which enforces Zero Data Retention. Under normal API usage, data would be stored on OpenAI's servers for 30 days. However, with this ZDR in place, no input data is retained at all.`,
  },
  {
    category: "data",
    question: `Will the issues and code sent to OpenAI using GitAuto in our company's repository remain on GitAuto's servers?`,

  {
    category: "data",
    question: `Are the issues and code sent to OpenAI from our company's repository using GitAuto subject to OpenAI's learning?`,

  },
  {
    category: "features",
    question: `Does GitAuto only work on GitHub? Is it not compatible with GitLab or BitBucket?`,

  },
  {
    category: "features",
    question: `Dear GitAuto: What inputs does GitAuto use?`,

  },
  {
    category: "features",
    question: `What does GitAuto output?`,
    answer: `For bug fixes, GitAuto outputs a pull request that includes the issue number, the cause of the bug, how to reproduce it, and how to fix it. For feature development, GitAuto outputs a pull request that includes the issue number, an overview of the feature, why the feature is needed, and how to implement it.`,
  },
  {
    category: "features",
    question: `Does GitAuto automatically merge the pull requests it creates?`,
    answer: `No, GitAuto does not automatically merge its own pull requests, nor does it have the authority to do so. More importantly, GitAuto's pull requests are intended to be reviewed by humans. Please review them and decide whether they should be merged. If there is a reason why they cannot be merged, please provide feedback, and we will attempt to improve: ${EMAIL}`,
  },
  {
    category: "language",

    question: `I would like to use GitAuto in my company's repository, but can it only be installed by the repository owner?`,
    answer: `Your organization owners or repository admins can install GitAuto (and all the GitHub apps).

    question: `If a non-owner tries to install, will the admin be notified?`,

    category: "pricing",
    question: `What happens to unused credits in the Standard plan?`,
    answer: `Unused credits remain in your account and don't expire for 1 year. You simply pay $${CREDIT_PRICING.PER_PR.AMOUNT_USD} per PR as you use them. You can check your current credit balance on your [Credits Dashboard](${RELATIVE_URLS.DASHBOARD.CREDITS}).`,
  },
  {
    category: "pricing",
    question: `What happens when I run out of credits?`,
    answer: `When your credit balance reaches $0, GitAuto will stop generating PRs. Simply purchase more credits to continue. If you've enabled auto-reload, credits will be automatically purchased when your balance falls below your threshold. You can monitor your usage on your [Credits Dashboard](${RELATIVE_URLS.DASHBOARD.CREDITS}).`,
  },
  {
    category: "pricing",
    question: `How does the credit system work?`,
    answer: `Credits are pre-paid funds that you purchase in advance. Each PR generation costs $${CREDIT_PRICING.PER_PR.AMOUNT_USD}, which is automatically deducted from your credit balance. Credits expire after 1 year, and you can set up auto-reload to automatically purchase more credits when your balance gets low.`,
  },
  {
    category: "pricing",
    question: `Can I purchase credits in bulk for volume discounts?`,

You can purchase any amount between $${CREDIT_PRICING.PURCHASE_LIMITS.MIN_AMOUNT_USD} and $${CREDIT_PRICING.PURCHASE_LIMITS.MAX_AMOUNT_USD.toLocaleString()}.`,
