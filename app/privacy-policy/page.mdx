If you choose to register in this way, we will collect the information described in the section called "HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?" below.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

<br />

**Information automatically collected**

<br />

**In Short**: _Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services._

<br />

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the
Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name
or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your
IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences,
referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you
use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily
needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal
analytics and reporting purposes.

<br />
The information we collect includes:

- _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is
  service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically
  collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending
  on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information,
  browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such
  as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches,
  and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information
  (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware
  settings).

<br />

**Information collected from other sources**

<br />

**In Short:** We may collect limited data from public databases, marketing partners,
social media platforms, and other outside sources.

<br />

In order to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, offers, and services
to you and update our records, we may obtain information about you from other sources,
such as public databases, joint marketing partners, affiliate programs, data providers,
social media platforms, and from other third parties. This information includes mailing
addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior
data), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, social media profiles, social media URLs,
and custom profiles, for purposes of targeted advertising and event promotion. If
you interact with us on a social media platform using your social media account (e.g.,
Facebook or Twitter), we receive personal information about you such as your name,
email address, and gender. Any personal information that we collect from your social
media account depends on your social media account's privacy settings.

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

<br />

**We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:**

- **To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.** We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.
- **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.** We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.

## 3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.

<br />

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

## 4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

**In Short:** If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

<br />

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

## 5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

<br />

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

<br />

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

**In Short:** We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

<br />

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

**In Short:** We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

<br />

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at [info@gitauto.ai](mailto:info@gitauto.ai).

<br />

## 8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**In Short:** You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

<br />

**<u>Withdrawing your consent:</u>** If we are relying on your consent to process
your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending
on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You
can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.

<br />

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

<br />

**Account Information**

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

- Contact us using the contact information provided.

<br />

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

<br />

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at [info@gitauto.ai](mailto:info@gitauto.ai).

## 9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

## 10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**In Short:** If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.

**<u>CCPA Privacy Notice</u>**

<br />

This section applies only to California residents. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the rights listed below.

<br />

The California Code of Regulations defines a "residents" as:

    (1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose and

    (2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is
    outside the State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose

<br />

All other individuals are defined as "non-residents."

<br />

If this definition of "resident" applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.

<br />

**Your rights with respect to your personal data**

<br />

**<u>Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete</u>**

<br />

You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

<br />

**<u>Right to be informed — Request to know</u>**

<br />

Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

- whether we collect and use your personal information;
- the categories of personal information that we collect;
- the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
- whether we sell or share personal information to third parties;
- the categories of personal information that we sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose;
- the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose;
- the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information;
- and the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.

<br />

In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to reidentify individual data to verify a consumer request.

<br />

We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

<br />

**<u>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</u>**

<br />

We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.

<br />

**<u>Verification process</u>**

<br />

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

<br />

We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

<br />

**<u>Other privacy rights</u>**

- You may object to the processing of your personal information.
- You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
- You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
- You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
