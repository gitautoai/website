# Why You Need Both Manual and Automated Tests

A recent [Hacker News discussion about QA practices](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41732084) discussed manual vs automated testing. One commenter made a point: "You need _both_ automated and manual testing for a high-quality product" because while automated testing is "an order of magnitude cheaper," manual testing brings value because "humans are a lot more clever."

**I agree, but with one caveat:** most teams get the balance wrong.

## The Problem: Manual Busywork

Most "manual testing" is actually manual busywork: repetitive regression checks that could be automated. When teams spend 70% of QA time on repetitive tasks, they're doing expensive, error-prone automation.

**Automate this:**
- Regression tests before releases
- API response validation  
- Identical user flow checks
- Database state validation

**Keep manual for this:**
- Exploring edge cases
- Evaluating user experience
- Investigating complex bugs
- Validating business logic

## The Solution

**Step 1:** Audit your manual testing. Categorize as "busywork" (automate) or "judgment calls" (keep manual).

**Step 2:** Generate tests automatically for every pull request: unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.

**Step 3:** Reposition manual testers as quality partners who define criteria, conduct exploratory testing, and validate user experience.

## The Bottom Line

The HN commenter was right: you need both approaches. But here's where I disagree with current practice: most teams use manual testing for the wrong things.

**Automated testing should handle:** Repetitive regression checks, API validations, data integrity.

**Manual testing should handle:** Exploratory testing, user experience evaluation, edge case discovery.

Get this balance right, and you get cost-efficient automation plus intelligent human testing. Get it wrong, and you get expensive, unreliable quality assurance.
