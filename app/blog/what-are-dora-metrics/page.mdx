# What are DORA Metrics?

[DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/) are a key benchmark for measuring software delivery performance. These metrics help teams assess their capabilities and drive improvements.

## The Four Key Metrics

1. **Change Lead Time**

   - Time from code commit to deployment.
   - Shorter lead time indicates faster delivery and efficiency.

2. **Deployment Frequency**

   - How often new releases are deployed.
   - Higher frequency indicates more frequent and stable delivery.

3. **Change Failure Rate**

   - Percentage of deployments causing production failures.
   - Lower rate means higher stability.

4. **Failed Deployment Recovery Time**

   - Time to recover from deployment failures.
   - Faster recovery reflects resilience and effective processes.

## Performance Levels

Below is a DORA performance chart for reference:

| Performance Level | Change Lead Time                 | Deployment Frequency                             | Change Failure Rate | Failed Deployment Recovery Time | Percentage of Respondents |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Elite**         | Less than one day                | On demand (multiple deploys per day)             | 5%                  | Less than one hour              | 19% (18-20%)              |
| **High**          | Between one day and one week     | Between once per day and once per week           | 20%                 | Less than one day               | 22% (21-23%)              |
| **Medium**        | Between one week and one month   | Between once per week and once per month         | 10%                 | Less than one day               | 35% (33-36%)              |
| **Low**           | Between one month and six months | Between once per month and once every six months | 40%                 | Between one week and one month  | 25% (23-26%)              |

## Why Improve Performance?

Improving DORA metrics leads to:

- **Faster Value Delivery**: Accelerates the delivery of features and fixes to users.
- **Higher Reliability**: Reduces downtime and customer impact from failures.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Teams that release faster and more reliably outperform slower competitors.

## How DORA Metrics Relate to GitAuto

[GitAuto](/) is a coding agent that writes code and opens pull requests from backlog tickets for software engineering managers who want to complete more bug fixes and feature requests. By automating these processes, GitAuto shortens **Change Lead Time**, increases **Deployment Frequency**, and shortens **Failed Recovery Time**, directly improving your **Software Delivery Performance**.

These improvements lead to:

- **Reduced Engineer Burnout**: Lightens the burden on engineers, helping to prevent burnout and maintain a healthier work-life balance.
- **Improved Job Satisfaction**: Allows engineers to focus on higher-quality, more impactful tasks, increasing their engagement and encouraging them to stay longer with the team.
- **Improved Customer Satisfaction**: Shortens the time from customer or stakeholder request to delivery, improving customer satisfaction.
